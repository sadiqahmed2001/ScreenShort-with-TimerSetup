# ScreenShort-with-TimerSetup
When you execute this script, you will be prompted to input the delay time. After setting the delay period, it will wait for that time before taking a screenshot. When the delay time is up, it takes a screenshot, shows it, and saves it as "myscreenshorts.png" in the current directory.
